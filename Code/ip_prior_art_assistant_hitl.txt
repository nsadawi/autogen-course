The ip_prior_art_assistant_hitl.py script implements HITL.
It's an extension of the ip_prior_art_assistant.py so please read its corresponding info file for more details.

* How HITL is implemented: 
- Adds an approver (UserProxyAgent) that pauses the workflow and asks the human to: 
APPROVE → allow the drafter to produce the final memo
MORE: ... → request extra research/synonyms/more excerpts and loop again
STOP → end the run

- Updates the critic to end with either HITL_APPROVAL_NEEDED or HITL_MORE_RESEARCH_NEEDED.

- Updates the drafter so it only outputs FINAL_READY if the human approved.

- Keeps the existing tool functions (pa_list_docs, pa_search, pa_get_excerpt) and researcher tool access.

This pattern follows AutoGen AgentChat HITL using UserProxyAgent


* How it behaves (HITL loop): 
- After critic, the approver prompts you in the terminal.
- If you type MORE: search for synonyms of “audit log” + find excerpts about “policy citations”, the cycle continues:
  + The next round’s planner will incorporate that instruction (per its prompt),
  + researcher will use tools again,
  + critic re-checks,
  + approver asks again,
  + drafter only finalizes after APPROVE.
