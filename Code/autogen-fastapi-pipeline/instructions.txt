1- Create the following folder(s) and file(s):
autogen-fastapi-pipeline/
  app.py
  prior_art/                # optional: local docs for "search"
    doc1.txt
    doc2.txt



2- Install dependencies:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -U fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv
pip install -U autogen-agentchat "autogen-ext[openai]" "autogen-ext[anthropic]"
pip install -U scikit-learn


Notes:
autogen-agentchat + autogen-ext[openai] is the core for AgentChat + OpenAI client.
autogen-ext[anthropic] enables the Anthropic client for Claude (optional but requested).


3- Set environment variables:
Minimum (to work): OpenAI:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."

Optional (Gemini for planning via OpenAI-compatible endpoint):
export GEMINI_BASE_URL="https://YOUR_OPENAI_COMPAT_ENDPOINT/v1"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.0-flash"   # example name; depends on your endpoint/provider


Optional (Claude for review):
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
export CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"


Also choose GPT model for execution:
export OPENAI_EXEC_MODEL="gpt-4o"

Provider compatibility warning (real-world): “Gemini via OpenAI-compatible endpoint” depends on the gateway you use. If it doesn’t behave perfectly like OpenAI, the app will still run because it falls back to OpenAI.


4- Run the server:
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000


Open:
Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Health: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health


5- How to use it (example):
Step A- Start a run:
You can use the FastAPI "Swagger" UI. FastAPI comes with a built-in interface that allows you to test endpoints directly.
Here is what you need to do:
 a- Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (replace the IP/port if yours is different).
 b- Find the Route: Look for the POST /runs/start section and click to expand it.
 c- Try it out: Click the "Try it out" button.
 d- Input Data: Paste your JSON body into the text area. You can try something like:
 {
  "invention_disclosure": "A system that scans prior-art documents for claim-like features and summarizes novelty/obviousness risk using evidence excerpts from the corpus.",
  "constraints": "Focus on software patents; include clear uncertainty statements; do not claim legal conclusions.",
  "top_k_docs": 5
 }
 e- Execute: Click the big blue "Execute" button. You will see the response body and status code immediately below.

The response should contain:
- run_id
- an approval_request.transcript that includes the planner plan, executor tool calls, and reviewer verdict.

Step B— Approve or reject:
 a- Now find the POST /runs/{run_id}/approve section and click to expand it.
 b- Paste the run_id from Step A into the run_id text box.
 c- Paste something like the following JSON to approve:  
{
  "decision": "APPROVE",
  "approver_notes": "Make the risk section more explicit and add recommended next steps for deeper search."
}
 d- Execute: Click the big blue "Execute" button. You will get final_output (the final memo). .


---- Extra -----
You can also use 'curl' from command line if you have it installed.
Something like the following should work:

curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/start' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "invention_disclosure": "A system that scans prior-art documents for claim-like features and summarizes novelty/obviousness risk using evidence excerpts from the corpus.",
  "constraints": "Focus on software patents; include clear uncertainty statements; do not claim legal conclusions.",
  "top_k_docs": 5
}'


---- Python ----
You can also use Python:

import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/start"
data = {
    "invention_disclosure": "A system that scans prior-art documents...",
    "constraints": "Focus on software patents; include clear uncertainty statements...",
    "top_k_docs": 5
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)

print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
print(response.json())
