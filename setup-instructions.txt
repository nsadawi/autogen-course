Make sure you install the required libraries (we might need more packages later, we'll install them on the go):
pip install -U "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai]"


If you also want Claude (Anthropic) support via AutoGen extension:
pip install -U "autogen-ext[anthropic]"


(Optional but strongly recommended) Load keys from a .env file
pip install -U python-dotenv


Make sure you create an OpenAI key and add it to your environment as follows:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key_here"


For other providers such as Google:
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
# OR
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key_here"


Google’s docs state the SDK can pick up GEMINI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY.
